# Psychic-Game

This program allows user interaction. The user is randomly choosing a letter in hopes
to randomly match the computer's randomly chosen letter. If the user clicks a key that
is not a letter, user is notified. There are counters displayed showing amount of guesses,
wins, losses, and which keys have been selected.

This project is useful for interactive webpages/games.

Users who would like to create this program can first get started by developing a psuedo code.
From there users can utilize text books or online websites such as Stackoverflow, W3schools,
and many more - simply google  your questions with the specific language!

I maintain this program as well as its only contributor!

Thak you for reading!
